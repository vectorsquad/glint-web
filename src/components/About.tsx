      <p>We are offering a completely free and open-source software to support students who are looking to
        better memorize information and improve study routines. Applications like Anki, while amazing, lack a
        modern feeling and solve one problem very well, memorization via flashcards. However, we are looking
        to improve multiple aspects of the learning process for students.

        We take advantage of the Pomodoro technique to enhance productivity and focus. Our web app
        includes a built-in Pomodoro timer, allowing students to break their study sessions into manageable
        intervals. This method helps to maintain concentration, reduce burnout, and ensure efficient use of
        study time. By integrating this technique, we aim to create a more holistic and effective learning
        experience for students.
